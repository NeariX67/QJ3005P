So i wrote this program together with my friend, to have a nice program to control my powersupply (Komerci Qj3005P) via a serial port.
This program shows you the current voltage, current and watt usage.
You can set your desired voltage and current with sliders and precily with a stepper.
I added a small window to show the last 40 seconds of recorded data.
All the data will be stored internally and can be saved as a csv file with the "datalogger" button.
With that, you got all the data in an excel sheet which you can use to create a large diagram.

TODO:
Fix for failing voltage setting (needs multiple clicks to set the desired voltage)


Note:
This program is consuming 27% of my CPU (i7-4790k) and could cause serious performance problems on weaker computers!
